Shreya developed the NGO Dashboard module, enabling NGOs to add, edit, and manage their projects and details.

Leisha designed the public interface displaying NGO and project information.

Samidha customized the admin panel and enhanced the visual styling using Bootstrap.

Each member worked in their own branch and created Pull Requests after testing.

Shreya handled reviewing, merging, and resolving Git conflicts to produce the final integrated build.

üí° Outcome

A fully functional and collaborative NGO Tracker Web Application built using Django.
The system supports user authentication, NGO project management, public visibility, and admin control ‚Äî all integrated into a clean, responsive interface with efficient GitHub-based teamwork.
